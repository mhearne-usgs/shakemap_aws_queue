# shake_path: The full path to the 'shake' executable. If you are running

#             path (e.g., if which shake gives you 
#             '~/miniconda/envs/shakemap/bin/shake' and your installation
#             is in '/home/shake', then you'd want to set shake_path to
#             '/home/shake/miniconda/envs/shakemap/bin/shake'). The default
#             is simply 'shake', in which case sm_queue will need to be

# max_process_time : the length of time (in seconds) that queue will

#                    the processing time exceeds this amount, the 
#                    child will be killed. This parameter is helpful to
#                    handle situations where shake hangs (e.g., while 
#                    trying to send email) and queue stops processing
#                    new events as a result. The default is 600. The 
#                    value must be >= 0, but should be set generously
#                    enough so that any automatic run has time to 
#                    complete.

# max_subprocesses : The maximum number of (shake) subprocesses allowed
#                    to run at the same time. Triggers in excess of this
#                    mumber will be queued until an existing subprocess
#                    finishes. Queued events will be run in order of 
#                    largest magnitude first. Cancellations are not
#                    queued, they are run immediately. The default is 4.

#       max_subprocesses = 2

# old_event_age : do not process events whose origin times are greater than

#                    than this long into the future (should be relatively
#                    short).
# The default is to process all events regardless of age.
#
# The age format is a positive integer followed by a suffix of "y" (years),

# associate_interval: Time between runs of

#                     then don't set the parameter, or set it to -1, 
#                     indicating that associateAll with never run. As with
#                     other time parameters this is an integer (minutes)
#                     appended with "m", "h", "d", or "y" (minutes, hours,

# max_trigger_wait: If a trigger is received and:
#    a) the event is currently being run, it is scheduled to be rerun
#       no later than "max_trigger_wait" in the future; or
#    b) the event is due for a repeat no later than "max_trigger_wait"
#       in the future, then the trigger is "shelved" until the scheduled
#       repeat; or
#    c) the event was run no earlier than "max_trigger_wait" in the past,
#       it is scheduled to be run "max_trigger_wait" in the future
#
# The purpose of this parameter is to prevent the event from being rerun
# too often when many triggers are anticipated, but to make sure that the
# event is rerun in a timely fashion in response to changes in the origin,
# available data, etc. It should be a fairly short period; 5m is the default.
#
# The format is is a positive integer (minutes) appended with "m", "h", "d", 
# or "y" (minutes, hours, days, or years). 0 (zero) is an acceptable value
# and will result in the trigger being honored as soon as possible.

#                 for example, to allow time for ground motion data to
#                 arrive before running the event. Each network is
#                 specified separately using the following form:
#
#                 netid = delay
#
#                 where netid is the network's ID, and delay is a time
#                 specified as described above in the 'repeats' section.
#                 The network ID must match exactly the ID in the 
#                 event/origin structure sent to the queue.
# 
# Example
# The line:
#
#           ci = 5m
#
# will delay running events from the 'ci' network for 5 minutes after the
# origin time.
