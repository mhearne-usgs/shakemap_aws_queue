# max_process_time : the length of time (in seconds) that queue will 
#                    wait for a ShakeMap instance to complete; if 
#                    the processing time exceeds this amount, the 
#                    row in the running table will be deleted. 
#                    The default is 600. The 
#                    value must be >= 0, but should be set generously
#                    enough so that any automatic run has time to 
#                    complete.
#
# Example:
#
#         max_process_time : 300
#
###########################################################################

# max_running : The maximum number of (shake) subprocesses allowed
#                    to run at the same time. Triggers in excess of this
#                    mumber will be queued until an existing subprocess
#                    finishes. Queued events will be run in order of 
#                    largest magnitude first. Cancellations are not
#                    queued, they are run immediately. The default is 4.
#
# Example:
#
#       max_running : 2

# old_event_age : do not process events whose origin times are greater than
#                 this long before the present.
# future_event_age : do not process events whose origin times are greater
#                    than this long into the future (should be relatively
#                    short).
# The default is to process all events regardless of age.
#
# The age format is a positive integer followed by a suffix of "y" (years),
# "d" (days), or "m" (minutes).
#
# Example:
#
#       old_event_age : 1y
#       future_event_age : 5m
#
########################################################################### 
    old_event_age : 1y

# minmag: The minimum magnitude an event must achieve to be processed;
#         the default is 4.0; this value can be overridden if the event
#         falls within one of the "box" regions (specified below)
#
# Example:
#
# minmag : 4.0
#
###########################################################################
    minmag : 5.4

###########################################################################
# max_trigger_wait: If a trigger is received and:
#    a) the event is currently being run, it is scheduled to be rerun
#       no later than "max_trigger_wait" in the future; or
#    b) the event is due for a repeat no later than "max_trigger_wait"
#       in the future, then the trigger is "shelved" until the scheduled
#       repeat; or
#    c) the event was run no earlier than "max_trigger_wait" in the past,
#       it is scheduled to be run "max_trigger_wait" in the future
#
# The purpose of this parameter is to prevent the event from being rerun
# too often when many triggers are anticipated, but to make sure that the
# event is rerun in a timely fashion in response to changes in the origin,
# available data, etc. It should be a fairly short period; 5m is the default.
#
# The format is is a positive integer (minutes) appended with "m", "h", "d", 
# or "y" (minutes, hours, days, or years). 0 (zero) is an acceptable value
# and will result in the trigger being honored as soon as possible.

# Example:
#
#   max_trigger_wait : 10m
#

# boxes: "Metro boxes" (polygons, really) within which the magnitude "mag"
#        supersedes "minmag" (above); multiple boxes are allowed; if the 
#        boxes overlap, the first one encountered will be used; boxes are
#        optional, the default is to have no metro boxes.
#
#        NOTE: The order the boxes are searched is lexicographic. Therefore
#        you may wish to start them with a number (as in the example below),
#        or otherwise name them in a way that will guarantee they are 
#        searched in the order you intend.
#
#        Statement format:
#
#          box_name : '''mag, lat1, lon1, ... latN, lonN'''
#
#        The last coordinate is assumed to connect to the first. The
#        entire list must be enclosed in triple quotes. The list
#        may be broken onto several lines.
#
# Example:
#
# [polygons]
#     01_my_box : '''3.5,
#              33.50, -116.75,
#              33.50, -118.25,
#              34.33, -120.25,
#              34.75, -120.25,
#              34.75, -116.75'''
#     02_my_box2 : '''3.8,
#               34.50, -117.75,
#               34.50, -119.25,
#               34.33, -121.25,
#               34.75, -121.25,
#               34.75, -117.75'''
#
# In this example, 01_my_box will be searched before 02_my_box2 because
# the order of searching is lexicographic.
